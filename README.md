- Downloading playlist of youtube shorts is not available
- 1080p resolution is not available because YouTube used a protocol called DASH in which video file and audio of that video are two separate files. Because of this software needs to download both files separately and merging them alongside takes alot of time. So, that's why It is not available at the moment. Currenlty working on it, if possible then it will be available soon.
